Udacity - How to build a startup (EP245)
---------------
+ started_on: 01 oct 2012
    + Phase 1 - Get ready to sell
        + MVP - minimum viable product
            + meets minimal customer needs
        + Identify customers and markets avail.
        + JerseySquare example
+ on: 02 oct 2012 - Lecture 1.5b
+ on: 04 oct 2012 - Lecture 2
+ on: 13 Oct 2012 - Lecture 2.21
    + Value Proposition - satisfying a customer need
        + solve a pain & create a gain => MVP
        + product market fit at the intersection of prod/market
        + keep in mind to "get out of the building"
    + Customer Segment or market
        + model the product'st "Persona"
        + create Pain Killers - problem vs need
        + depending on market web/physical/etc you need a model to get feedback on your solution
        + Value proposition - why hasn't it been solved yet?
        + ayasdi - tech insight / twitter - market insight
+ on: 14 Oct 2012 - Lecture 3.1
+ on: 23 Oct 2012 - Lecture 4.1
    + Customer segments
        + understand whom are the people who might buy your product
        + there might different segments available
        + create a "day in the life" of a customer for a persona
        + customer gains - list of what can they win by using your product
        + you have to validate some of your hypothesis
        + customer pains - opposite version of gains, need to understand it
        + know everything about your customers - create a customer persona
        + who's the customer - in context - payer might be a different person
        + B2B present less chances to get useful survey results compared to B2C
        + 2 sided market, e.g. google - searching users / paying advertisers
        + 4 types of startups: existing market, resegment market, new , clone
            + changes everything: initial costs, market size, sales model
        + chasm between early adopters and mainstream market depending on startup type
            + wider depending on market type
        + revenue stream for each value proposition
+ on: 1 nov 2012 - Lecture 4.5
    + physical distribution channel (4.5) 
    + solution complexity: system integrators - handle the most complex solutions > Direct Sales > VAR > Retail > Web
    + as we go up solution complexity, the value added increases; higher volume are at the low end
    + channel economics
        + direct sales: e.g. $100 = cost of raw materials ($33) + r&d, sales & gen. admin ($20) + discount ($10) + PROFIT ($37)
        + indirect sales (reseller): cost of r.m. ($33) + r&d, sales & gen. admin ($15) = 48$ + discount ($10) + reseller ($20) + PROFIT ($22)
        + selling costs are lower, but losing more on total profit
    + Customer Relationships
        + how do you _get_, _keep_ and _grow_ customers? - double barrelled funnel the same, slighty different for web and physical products
             + get - viral loop, in-funnel / keep / grow, out-funnel
        + update the consumer archetype, how do they know you and research about your products, how do they buy?
        + have an opinion based on a fact, try to continually refine the archetype
        + pay - PR to promote your product or company / goog or fb pads based on archetype / trade shows / e-mail / mail / 
        + unpaid - blogs, guest articles, social media, speeches
        + physical channel: awareness, interest, consideration, purchase
            + modify the funnnel to fit your needs, use it as a template
        + 5.11 - 2 nov 2012
        + getting customers is more expensive than keeping customers
        + keeping customers using loyalty programs, newsletters
        + grow customers - end funnel
            + up sell - different product lines w/ different prices / cross sell - selling similar products / referrals (physical)
        + get mobile funnel: acquire - how to get them to visit your site / activate - pay / sign up - engage w/ the product
            + 2-step process; customer aquisition cost (CAC) - 10k users, .5 ad word -ppclick, 500 sign up, 50 paying => $100 C.A.C.
        + churn: how many customers leave
        +  grow for web: lifetime value (LTV), how much will they spend from get/keep/grow, we must have LTV > CAC
        + ideally LTV should be (much) higher than CAC
+ on: 6 Nov 2012 - Lecture 6.1
    + Common mistakes
        + revenue stream *IS NOT* the price, and a lower price than competition is not necessary needed
        + it must be driven by the customers
        + *pricing must be based on value and not cost*, customer should feel that
    + Revenue stream: the _strategy_ of the company to generate _cash_ from each customer segment
        + each revenue stream may get different pricing tactics
    + Pricing: the tactics used to set the prices
        + fixed: value based on customer segment, based on volume, cost + mark-update
        + dynamic: negotiable, based on yield, auctions
        + depending on your customers, get out of the building :)
    + Fee: proportional to the usage of the service / flat fee to access to service / licensing - fee for use IP
+ on: 7 Nov 2012 - Lecture 6.10
    + Market types affects pricing
        + how will the competition react, can we undercut them?
        + what are their costs    
    + Single/multi-sided market: e.g. Google - cares about users first, revenues second
        + for a physical channel, go for both at the same time
        + for multi-sided market, talk to the _payers_ not only the users
    + "revenue first" companies - focusing on revenue more than others
    + "Hockey stick" - startups in a new market, flat revenue initially, then after an inflexion point, exponential growth
        + 1st year bump - due to early adopters
    + "draw the diagram" on how you'll be making money
    + key revenue model questions
        + what are the customers paying for and how is easy is for them to keep paying
        + _don't put all features in the initial product_ (packaging)
        + estimate the market size: CAC, LTV, how many units will you selling
    + get feedback from customers 100 web / 10 non-web
+ on:11 Nov 2012 - Lecture 7.1 - Partners
    + Partners: what type of relationships you need to have with them
    + shared economics, what's in it for your partner / mutual success & failure
    + working together with others to help build your company
    + strategic alliance: use partner to build a "whole product", using 3rd parties to provide solution to customers
    + greatest strategic alliance: iPod (apple + record labels)
    + joint business development: intel + OEMs => intel inside,  promotion and ads programs
    + in new market no need for "earlyvangelists", as most tend to fail
    + coopetition: to do something jointly for their industry (tradeshows, associations)
    + key suppliers: outsource part of company to 3rd party - backoffice, manufacture
    + virtual channels/traffic partners: deliver predictable levels of customers (web)
    + risks: e.g. Boeing building 787 - outsource all manufacturing, supply chain too scattered - decisions made by accountants and not engineers
    + risks: longest of their decision schedule is yours now as well; no clear ownership of the customers; products lacks vision; difficult to unwind or end
    + investments from large companies: "what's in it for us?" - buy us without (investing) money
        + who's the sponsor? and what's the motivation?
    + understand that you're not a PEER to large companies
    + partners can be a potential acquirer
    + try to understand if customers want you to have partnerships
+ on 12 Nov 2012 - Lecture 8 - Resources, Activities and Costs
    + most important assets: finance / money, IP, physical resources, human resources
    + 4 critical: physical, human, financial, intellectual
        + physical goods are capital intensive, how to scale
        + easy to start-up, especially in softare, some rough calculations on capital invested vs. possible gains
            + VC in both operating and financing phases, angels, friends and kickstarter in financing phase only
            + lease-lines/factoring only in operating mode
+ on 26 Nov 2012- Lecture 8
    + HR: teacher: learn about a subject, improve a skill - coach, mentor - giving and taking advice
    + always hire people better than you!
    + IP: trademark - you can protect branding (marks, logos), copyright the 'creative work', contract/NDA, patent the 'inventions'
    + Costs (alywas < Revenue) in-sync w/ investors from day 1
        + fixed costs: building, employees - every month, don't move
        + what are the most important cost to operate the business
        + startups search for the execution metrics, but you *need to first understand the metrics that matter*
        + burn rate - how much money are spent per month
+ Reading recommendations:
    + Startup Owner's Manual
    + Business Model Generation
    + The Innovator Dillema / The Innovator Solution
+ goal: 2013

Udacity - Software Testing (CS258)
---------------
+ started_on: 27 jun 2012
+ on: 27 Jun 2012 - 1.11
    + python -O : optimize, disable assertions
    + valgrind: always assertions are enabled, about 5% of time looks ok
    + nasa: most phases w/ assertions, landing assertions disabled
    + try to test w/ values sampled from entire domain
    + domain restrictions are acceptable as long as they are documented
    + for OSes we should test all values even if it's outside the specs (e.g. negative vals for >0 reqs.)
    + same for GUIs, the same trust boundary is present, which needs testing
+ on: 11 Nov 2012 - 1.23
    + use defensive coding, trying to prevent corner cases/errors
+ not on goal2013
