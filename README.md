Udacity - How to build a startup (EP245)
---------------
+ started_on: 01 oct 2012
    + Phase 1 - Get ready to sell
        + MVP - minimum viable product
            + meets minimal customer needs
        + Identify customers and markets avail.
        + JerseySquare example
+ on: 02 oct 2012 - Lecture 1.5b
+ on: 04 oct 2012 - Lecture 2
+ on: 13 Oct 2012 - Lecture 2.21
    + Value Proposition - satisfying a customer need
        + solve a pain & create a gain => MVP
        + product market fit at the intersection of prod/market
        + keep in mind to "get out of the building"
    + Customer Segment or market
        + model the product'st "Persona"
        + create Pain Killers - problem vs need
        + depending on market web/physical/etc you need a model to get feedback on your solution
        + Value proposition - why hasn't it been solved yet?
        + ayasdi - tech insight / twitter - market insight
+ on: 14 Oct 2012 - Lecture 3.1
+ on: 23 Oct 2012 - Lecture 4.1
    + Customer segments
        + understand whom are the people who might buy your product
        + there might different segments available
        + create a "day in the life" of a customer for a persona
        + customer gains - list of what can they win by using your product
        + you have to validate some of your hypothesis
        + customer pains - opposite version of gains, need to understand it
        + know everything about your customers - create a customer persona
        + who's the customer - in context - payer might be a different person
        + B2B present less chances to get useful survey results compared to B2C
        + 2 sided market, e.g. google - searching users / paying advertisers
        + 4 types of startups: existing market, resegment market, new , clone
            + changes everything: initial costs, market size, sales model
        + chasm between early adopters and mainstream market depending on startup type
            + wider depending on market type
        + revenue stream for each value proposition
+ on: 1 nov 2012 - Lecture 4.5
    + physical distribution channel (4.5) 
    + solution complexity: system integrators - handle the most complex solutions > Direct Sales > VAR > Retail > Web
    + as we go up solution complexity, the value added increases; higher volume are at the low end
    + channel economics
        + direct sales: e.g. $100 = cost of raw materials ($33) + r&d, sales & gen. admin ($20) + discount ($10) + PROFIT ($37)
        + indirect sales (reseller): cost of r.m. ($33) + r&d, sales & gen. admin ($15) = 48$ + discount ($10) + reseller ($20) + PROFIT ($22)
        + selling costs are lower, but losing more on total profit
    + Customer Relationships
        + how do you _get_, _keep_ and _grow_ customers? - double barrelled funnel the same, slighty different for web and physical products
             + get - viral loop, in-funnel / keep / grow, out-funnel
        + update the consumer archetype, how do they know you and research about your products, how do they buy?
        + have an opinion based on a fact, try to continually refine the archetype
        + pay - PR to promote your product or company / goog or fb pads based on archetype / trade shows / e-mail / mail / 
        + unpaid - blogs, guest articles, social media, speeches
        + physical channel: awareness, interest, consideration, purchase
            + modify the funnnel to fit your needs, use it as a template
        + 5.11 - 2 nov 2012
        + getting customers is more expensive than keeping customers
        + keeping customers using loyalty programs, newsletters
        + grow customers - end funnel
            + up sell - different product lines w/ different prices / cross sell - selling similar products / referrals (physical)
        + get mobile funnel: acquire - how to get them to visit your site / activate - pay / sign up - engage w/ the product
            + 2-step process; customer aquisition cost (CAC) - 10k users, .5 ad word -ppclick, 500 sign up, 50 paying => $100 C.A.C.
        + churn: how many customers leave
        +  grow for web: lifetime value (LTV), how much will they spend from get/keep/grow, we must have LTV > CAC
        + ideally LTV should be (much) higher than CAC
