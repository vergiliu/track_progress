Boneshaker by Christie Priest [aug2012-oct2012]
In an approximate version of the Seattle gold rush, a true steampunk story 
involving a deadly gas, drugs, leather and a cloudy and misty atmosphere. 
Did I mention zombies? Or airships powered by steam? 
Overall a nice and short read with a good story. Rating 4.5/5

Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug [oct2012]
The "bible" of web usability in its second incarnation. A couple of ideas or reminders from the book:
- Make the site natural to the user and his actions
- Build billboards not newspapers
- Make stuff visible and easy to determine what's its function to the user
- "Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rif of what's left"
